        Hi! Hopefully you enjoy the site (although it's not really much of a website right now). I <br>
        really enjoy cooking and especially stuff like meats and cheeses, but never really had the <br>
        opportunity to share what I make with a lot of people and show why it's something I enjoy. <br>
        Even if it doesn't get much use I hope that it at least gets people to think. Probably sounds <br>
        silly but there's a lot that goes into making all this stuff and it's pretty interesting! Not <br>
        sure what the prices for things would look like yet, but I'm hoping to make products that not <br>
        only taste good, but are something that people feel are worth paying for (which would ideally <br>
        mean low prices although it does get a little expensive which is really why I'm charging for it <br>
        to begin with).
